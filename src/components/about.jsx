      <p>
        Hello! I'm Susan. I'm a computer science grad with an MBA (don't hold it
        against me) looking for a software engineering opportunity. My extensive
        career has always been in tech - including data analysis, testing and
        optimization, and product manangement.{" "}
      </p>
      <p>
        My enthusiasm for creating something from nothing has been a guiding
        force in my life and career. As a child, I wrote text-based games on a
        Commodore 64 computer in the BASIC language. In school, I made plush
        toys and art to raise money for charity organizations. As a product
        manager, I've worked closely with engineers to design, build and launch
        a variety of software.
      </p>
      <p>
        {" "}
        When I'm not staring at some type of screen, I'm probably doing arts &
        crafts, visiting a cat cafe, or singing Karaoke.
      </p>
