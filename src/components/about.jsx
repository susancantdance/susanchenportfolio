        From writing games in BASIC as a child to crafting plush toys for
        charity, being creative has been a guiding force in my life as well as
        my career. As a product manager, I've partnered closely with engineers
        to design, build and launch software.

        When I'm not staring at some type of screen, I'm probably doing arts &
        crafts, visiting a cat cafe, or singing Karaoke (Does that count as a
        screen?).
