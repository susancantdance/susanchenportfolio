        Hello! I'm Susan. I'm looking for my next opportunity as a software
        engineer.
      </p>
      <p>
        My experience in tech includes a CS degree from UCLA and an extensive
        career in product manangement. My technical skills include vanilla HTML,
        CSS, SQL, and Javascript. I have experience building full stack
        applications with React, Node.js, and Prisma ORM.

        When I'm not staring at some type of screen, I'm probably doing arts &
        crafts, visiting a cat cafe, or singing Karaoke (Does that count as a
        screen?).
      </p>
    </>
