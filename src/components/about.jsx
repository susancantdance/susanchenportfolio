      <p>
        Hello! I'm Susan. I'm a computer science grad with an MBA (don't hold it
        against me) looking for a software engineering opportunity. My extensive
        career in tech includes data analysis, testing and optimization, and
        product manangement.{" "}
      </p>
      <p>
        My enthusiasm for creating something from nothing has been a guiding
        force in my life and career: From writing text-based games on a
        Commodore 64 computer in the BASIC language -- to sewing plush toys to
        raise money for charity organizations. As a product manager, I've worked
        closely with engineers to design, build and launch a variety of
        software.
      </p>
      <p>
        {" "}
        When I'm not staring at some type of screen, I'm probably doing arts &
        crafts, visiting a cat cafe, or singing Karaoke (Does that count as a
        screen?).
      </p>
