      <p>
        Hello! I'm Susan. I'm a computer science grad with an MBA (don't hold it
        against me) looking for my next opportunity as a software engineer. My
        extensive career has always been in tech - including data analysis,
        testing and optimization, and product manangement.{" "}
      </p>
      <p>
        My enthusiasm for creating something from nothing has been a guiding
        force in my life and career. As a child, I wrote text-based games on a
        Commodore 64 computer in the BASIC language. In school, I sold art and
        hand-sewn plush toys for charity organizations. Most recently as a
        product manager, I've worked closely with engineers to design, build and
        launch a variety of software.
      </p>
      <p>
        {" "}
        When I'm not staring at some type of screen, I'm probably crafting,
        tending to my plants, or singing Karaoke.
      </p>
